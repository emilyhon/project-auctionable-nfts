# Auctionable NFT

## Concept
This is an NFT project which allows users to mint ERC-721 tokens with an auction mechanism, wherein the minted NFTs don't immediately get transfered into the minter's wallet. Instead, the minted NFTs are put up for bidding for a set duration. At the end of the auction duration, the NFT is then transferred to the highest bidder, or the original minter if no bids were placed.
